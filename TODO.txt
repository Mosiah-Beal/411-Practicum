TODO:
    [OLED]
        Use monitor.display flag to send output to OLED or Serial respectively (for all print messages)
        Get a graph of temperature/humid, print current temp/humid
        Give dedicated line to printing messages to user
    
    
    [MENU]
        Add shutdown function
        Add settings view/reset option
        Add toggle to view only readings/graph (cancel on keypad input)
        Show keypresses in live time when entering new values.


    [LOOP]
        Refactor handle functions to work independently and not take control from each other
        The goal is to have most of handlers work silently in background updating variables


    [General]
        Add Debugging levels to suppress output
        Test functions should be only for tests, make new ones for serial version or add if-else to pre-existing code
